The storm raged over the kingdom of Valderon, lightning tearing jagged scars across the sky as rain pounded the ancient castle walls. Inside, Sir Aldric knelt before the dying king, his sword planted in the stone floor. The old ruler's breath was shallow, his once-mighty voice reduced to a whisper.

“The Black Wolf rides for our gates,” the king rasped. “You are my last knight, Aldric. Swear to me—you will not let him take our home.”

Aldric bowed his head. He had served Valderon since boyhood, fought in wars, saved villages, and stood against sorcerers. But now, he was the last of his order, the others lost to years of battle.

“I swear it, my king.”

The king’s eyes closed for the final time, and the room fell silent. Aldric rose, gripping his sword. The Black Wolf—Lord Malagar, a traitor once thought vanquished—was returning.

Before dawn, Aldric rode to the castle gates, his battered armor gleaming in the torchlight. Below, a sea of torches burned in the night—Malagar’s army, surrounding the fortress like a pack of wolves.
