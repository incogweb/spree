# **ðŸ“– Spree**  
A web app designed to make reading fast and easy. **Still in progress**

---

## ðŸ§° **Roadmap**

Currently this app only features compatability for .txt files but I plan on adding support for most other major text file types such as .epub and more.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**

The primary purpose of this repository is to:
- Read faster
- Make a more compatible and lightweight reading app
- Test my skills in handling data with HTML

---

## ðŸ‘¥ **Credits**

I built this completely individually so if you plan on using this or sharing this code, then credit would be appreciated.

---

## ðŸ’» **Start Reading!**

You can either start using this now with the spree_test.txt file or upload your own .txt file and it should work.
